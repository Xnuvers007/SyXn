############ HTTP REQUEST ############
# The entire HTTP request, including the exploit string and a marker for the 
# SQL command to execute (__SQL2INJECT__)
# Be sure to include the vulnerable parameter and the character sequence that
# allows us to start injecting commands. In general this means, at least:
# - an apostrophe (if the parameter is a string)
# - a semicolon (to end the original query)
# It must also include everything necessary to properly close the original
# query, like an appropriate number of closing brackets. Don't forget to 
# URL-encode, where needed (e.g. a space must become '%20' or '+')
#
# For instance, if you need to inject something like the following:
#    aaa=1&bbb=x';exec+master..xp_cmdshell+'dir+c:'--
# then  parameter should look like this:
#    aaa=1&bbb=x';__SQL2INJECT__
# 
# Make sure that:
# 1. The --httprequest_start-- and-- httprequest_end-- markers are in place
# 2. All required headers are present
# 3. There are no spaces at the beginning of a line
# 4. There are not comment lines
# Consider copying the exact request that triggers the injection from a proxy 
# intercept (e.g.: BurpSuite), if unsure
#

# Note that in the last example the semicolon was encoded, otherwise the server would not
# parse __SQL2INJECT__ as part of VulnCookie

# Local host: your IP address (for backscan and revshell modes)
lhost = 192.168.60.1

# Interface to sniff when in backscan mode
device = eth0

# Evasion techniques to be used. Possible choices are:
# 1 - Query hex-encoding
# 2 - Comments as separators
# 3 - Random case
# 4 - Random URI encoding
# All techniques can be combined, so the following is legal:
# evasion = 1234
# However, keep in mind that using too many techniques at once leads to very
# long queries, that might create problems when using GET. Default: no evasion
# evasion = 12

# Path to metasploit executable. Only needed if msfpayload and
# msfcli are not already in the path
msfpath = /home/user/trunk/

# Encoder to use with msfencode. If the option is not present, no encoding
# is used. However, it's definitely recommended to use it, if you suspect that
# an AV is present. A list of available encoders can be retrieved by simply
# running "msfencoder -l"
# msfencoder = x86/shikata_ga_nai

# Number of times to encode the metasploit payload. Default: 5
# msfencodecount = 4

# If you can execute commands but SQL Server does not run as SYSTEM,
# you can use churrasco.exe to steal the appropriate token and escalate
# privileges. Enable this option to use churrasco.exe before executing 
# a command. This is especially useful with the metasploit module and VNC
# Obviously, you first need to upload churrasco.exe using 
# the upload module!
usechurrasco = no

# Proxy host to use (default: none)
# proxyhost = 127.0.0.1

# Proxy port to use (default: 8080)
# proxyport = 8080


# Domain to use for dnstunnel mode
domain = sqlninja.net

# tcpdump filter (optional)
# filter = src host x.x.x.x

# Backscan timeout after web request conclusion (Default: 5 secs)
# timeout = 5

# Maximum hostname length for DNS tunnel (Max: 250 - Default: 250)
# hostnamelength = 250

# IP address to return to DNS queries (default: 10.255.255.254)
# resolvedip = 10.255.255.254

# Name of the procedure to use/create to launch commands. Default is
# "xp_cmdshell". If set to "NULL", openrowset+sp_oacreate will be used
# for each command
# xp_name = xp_cmdshell

# Time value for the WAITFOR during inference attack of fingerprint and
# bruteforce mode. A higher value makes things slower but will yeld more
# precise results against slow targets.
# Min: 3 seconds. Max: 59 seconds. Default: 5 seconds
blindtime = 5

# Number of script lines to upload with a single HTTP request. A higher number
# obviously means a faster upload. However, do not push this too high if your 
# request contains very long parameters. Maximum is 30, and 10 is a default
# safe value providing already a good speed
# lines_per_request = 10

# If the remote server returns a custom error page instead of a standard
# HTTP error code (e.g. 500 Server Error), it is wise to set this value to
# some string that is present in such a page. This will help sqlninja in
# figuring out if things seem to be wrong
# errorstring = "an error has occurred"

# By default, sqlninja appends two hyphens to the injected query in order
# to comment out any spurious SQL code. This is good and works in
# approximately 99% of the cases. However, you might want to change this
# behavior in some very specific scenarios. Change this setting only if you
# really know what you are doing,
# Possible values: yes/no
# appendcomment = yes

# When using the Metasploit module DEP is not a problem anymore, since in
# all recent versions of the framework the stager will take care of it by 
# itself. However, if needed you can still roll back to the old sqlninja 
# behavior and disable DEP by whitelisting the stager with a call to 
# xp_regwrite. To do so, set 'checkdep' to 'yes'
# checkdep = no

# You can override the standard marker used to detect where to inject the
# sql attack code. You will probably never need to change this
# sqlmarker = __SQL2INJECT__
